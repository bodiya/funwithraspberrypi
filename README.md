Fun With Raspberry Pi
==================
This is an introductory course on the Raspberry Pi that requires no electronics experience, and only minimal programming experience. It utilizes the Raspberry Pi model B, Pi Camera, and a variety of electronic components.

Overview
--------
<b>Class 1: Intro and setup</b><br>
Provides an overview of the hardware, helps you get your Pi set up and connected to your laptop via VNC. Then you'll connect a remote web service via Python, which will be used in later classes.<br>
<b>Class 2: Input and Output w/ GPIO</b><br>
Here you'll learn to read and write digital I/O, use softare PWM, and handle interrupts. You'll make lights blink, capture input, and make a simle etch-a-sketch.<br>
<b>Class 3: Advanced Input & the Internet of Things</b><br>
In this class you'll learn to read a temperature sensor, and communicate with an ADC/DAC chip via I2C. We'll also take a look at ThingSpeak, and show you how to push sensor information to a channel.<br>
<b>Class 4: Pi Camera</b><br>
Here you'll be introduced to the Pi Camera. You'll learn to take pictures and video via the command line and in Python, and stream the results to a remote location with a few different methods. We'll also take a quick look at Motion - a Python library to detect movement with the Pi Camera.<br>
<b>Class 5: MATLAB and the Raspberry Pi</b><br>
Lastly you'll learn to use the Raspberry Pi support package for MATLAB and Simulink. You'll interface with the Camera, I2C, and GPIO. We'll look at a simple color tracking algorithm in MATLAB, and show you how to use deploy code to the Pi as a Simulink target.
Code and schematics
--------
This repository contains the code and schematics for the all of the class exercises and @home projects. We're working to add setup instructions for each exercise to make them more independent of the slides, but it's still a work in progress.
