1. Load the w1-gpio kernel module
   (make sure to use pullup=1 for the parasite power sensor)
$ sudo modprobe w1-gpio pullup=1

2. Load the w1-therm kernel module
   (make sure to use strong_pullup=1 for the parasite power sensor)
$ sudo modprobe w1-therm strong_pullup=1

3. See if the sensor was detected
$ cd /sys/bus/w1/devices

There should be at least one directory like 28-*
If there's not, double check your connections and repeat steps 1-3
Then cd into the directory.
$ cd 28-*

4. Read the current temperature via the filesystem
$ cat w1_slave

If you get bogus values (for example, very high numbers that don't change)
then make sure the sensor has power, and that you used the
pullup and strong_pullup options when loading the kernel modules
